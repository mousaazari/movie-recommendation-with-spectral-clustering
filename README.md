# Recommender System with Collaborative Filtering and Spectral Clustering

To overcome problems such as sparsity of the data and long computation time, we propose a model that combines one of the most commonly used recommender algorithms, Collaborative Filtering (CF), with spectral clustering (SC) which obtains promising clustering results -compared to other clustering algorithms- with sparse data in relatively short computation time.

##Key Features
Collaborative Filtering (CF): A widely used recommendation technique that analyzes user-item interactions to predict user preferences and generate recommendations.

Spectral Clustering (SC): A clustering algorithm that utilizes the spectrum of a similarity matrix to partition data points into groups, providing efficient and accurate clustering results even with sparse data.

Improved Performance: By integrating CF with SC, our model addresses the sparsity issue and reduces computation time, resulting in enhanced recommendation quality and efficiency.

Scalability: Our approach is designed to handle large datasets, enabling effective recommendation generation even when dealing with massive amounts of user-item interactions.
