# movie-recommendation-with-spectral-clustering
## Information Retrieval course project in Bilkent Universiy
To overcome problems such as sparsity of the data and long computation time, we propose a model that combines one of the most commonly used recommender algorithms, Collaborative Filtering (CF), with spectral clustering (SC) which obtains promising clustering results -compared to other clustering algorithms- with sparse data in relatively short computation time.
